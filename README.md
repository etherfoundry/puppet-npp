Puppet Manifest Notepad++ UDL
==========

This is a simple UDL that was written for Notepad++ to aid in the construction of Puppet manifests. It includes syntax highlighting for many keywords, including the built-in resources, some variable formats, strings (including escapes), folding blocks on {}, and quite a few attributes on many of the build-in resources. The colors were picked somewhat randomly.
